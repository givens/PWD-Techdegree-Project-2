"""
Create variables and programming logic to divide the 18 players into three teams: Sharks, Dragons and Raptors. Make sure the teams have the same number of players on them, and that the experience players are divided equally across the three teams.

Create a text file named teams.txt that includes the name of a team, followed by the players on that team. List all three teams and their players.

In the list of teams include the team name on one line, followed by a separate line for each player. Include the player's name, whether the player has experience playing soccer, and the player's guardian names. Separate each bit of player information by a comma. For example, the text file might start something like this:
Sharks
Frank Jones, YES, Jim and Jan Jones
Sarah Palmer, YES, Robin and Sari Washington
Joe Smith, NO, Bob and Jamie Smith
